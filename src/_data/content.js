    body: "The Hives… on a creative hiatus… surely not? Yet, while it has been over ten years since the Swedish band’s last album, 2012’s Lex Hives, anyone fearing they have fallen into the ageing rock cliche of an act touring on past glories can rest easy. Yes, The Death Of Randy Fitzsimmons is The Hives first full album in over a decade, but as its macabre title hints, the reason for the band’s absence from the studio has been uniquely and suitably The Hives. There was a problem… the increasingly long absence of The Hives’ founder, mentor and songwriter, the limelight-shunning Randy Fitzsimmons. Now, returning for their final act since his mysterious disappearance, the band have delivered a record that is not just worthy of their legacy, but one that adds fresh lustre to The Hives. The Death Of Randy Fitzsimmons is a true renaissance.",

    body: 'Fat Dog are the most exciting breakthrough band of the past few years, conjurers of the sort of frenzied and wild live shows not seen in the capital for years and now the creators of WOOF., a brilliant and mind-bending debut album. A thrilling blend of electro-punk, rock’n’roll snarling, techno soundscapes, industrial-pop and rave euphoria, WOOF. is music for letting go to or, in the words of frontman Joe Love, “screaming-into-a-pillow music”.',

    body: 'English quintet Blossoms burst onto the British scene in the 2010s, quickly rising from local clubs to festival stages within a few short years. Their breakthrough debut landed in 2016 after years of anticipation, topping charts and winning fans with a catchy, synth-forward blend of Brit-pop and indie rock heard on songs like hit single “Charlemagne.” Incorporating more new wave influences on their follow-up, 2018’s Cool Like You, the band maintained their presence on U.K. charts and on the touring circuit. By the end of the decade, they were selling out shows, including one at a hometown stadium. The group entered a new decade in 2020 with their third LP, the lovelorn Foolish Loving Spaces. They soon followed with 2022’s Ribbon Around the Bomb.',
