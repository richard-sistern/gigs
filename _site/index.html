               Fat Dog are the most exciting breakthrough band of the past few years, conjurers of the sort of frenzied and wild live shows not seen in the capital for years and now the creators of WOOF., a brilliant and mind-bending debut album. A thrilling blend of electro-punk, rock’n’roll snarling, techno soundscapes, industrial-pop and rave euphoria, WOOF. is music for letting go to or, in the words of frontman Joe Love, “screaming-into-a-pillow music”.

               From the bowels of Disgraceland, Rock & Roll icons of the afterlife are raised from the dead! Rock & Roll meets Grunge as Elvis fronts Nirvana and gives the band the front man it’s been missing since ’94. Elvana tear through Nirvana’s catalogue whilst splicing in grunged up sections of the king of rock & rolls finest moments, culminating in a whopper mash up of overdrive & old school Rockabilly. It smells like cheeseburgers and teen spirit, daddy-o!

               Good Mood Music. Unwavered by movements around them, Deco have become one of the UK’s most intriguing viral pop acts in the last 2 years. With a persistent knack for classic songwriting and capturing millions across social media, the quintet, formed by siblings & lifelong friends, blend the contemporary with their love of the synth pop records, thrust upon them by their parents growing up. ‘Winning the internet’ in lockdown and beyond with millions of views for their viral mashups, Deco truly embody the sense of escapism they carry throughout their songwriting. They’ve appeared on National TV & radio, played BBC Radio 1’s Big Weekend, supported the likes of Nile Rodgers, A-ha & Boy George on tour & garnered endorsements from musical heroes. Wrapping up a successful 2023, with a sold out UK Tour and main stage festival appearances, Deco signed with with Liverpool based label Modern Sky working alongside Virgin Music. The 5 piece released their acclaimed 6 track ‘Nice Car’ EP in June 2023 & will be heading on the road with Nile Rodgers & CHIC this summer.

               English quintet Blossoms burst onto the British scene in the 2010s, quickly rising from local clubs to festival stages within a few short years. Their breakthrough debut landed in 2016 after years of anticipation, topping charts and winning fans with a catchy, synth-forward blend of Brit-pop and indie rock heard on songs like hit single “Charlemagne.” Incorporating more new wave influences on their follow-up, 2018’s Cool Like You, the band maintained their presence on U.K. charts and on the touring circuit. By the end of the decade, they were selling out shows, including one at a hometown stadium. The group entered a new decade in 2020 with their third LP, the lovelorn Foolish Loving Spaces. They soon followed with 2022’s Ribbon Around the Bomb.

               Maximo Park are today sharing brand-new single ‘Favourite Songs’ alongside news of upcoming UK and EU headline tour dates in the Autumn.<br><br>‘Favourite Songs’ is the bands own salute to the potency of pop music in its ability to provide solace in times of need, and a place to retreat into with like minds. Jerky riffs, shimmering synths and a driving chorus propel ‘Favourite Songs’ to a place of collective joy, while singer Paul Smith’s reassurances that “all of our troubles will fade away” ring out in elation. As the first new music from the band in more than 18 months its a song that finds them back in the mood for celebration, revelling in musics power to create the strongest of bonds and send the strongest of messages.<br><br>Singer Paul Smith comments on the song: “Our aim was to create a peppy yet powerful ode to the consolation of music and companionship in the face of other peoples preconceptions.”

               At the start of 2022, The Howlers, outwardly at least, were on a high. They had just completed a sold-out tour, off the back of recording their debut EP during the depths of the 2020 lockdowns. ‘We took the decision to bubble together during the pandemic,’ says lead-vocalist Adam Young, describing the band’s near-apocalyptic experience of travelling back and forth between their shared living accommodation and a rehearsal studio, made available to them by previous members of Palma Violets and Big Moon.<br><br>‘Everyone was queuing up with facemasks outside banks, there were protests, it was dystopian’, he recalls, of that time. Adam, bass player Guus Ter Braak, and their former drummer were living in close quarters, eating, and sleeping in a small house share, laying down the record against the precarious backdrop of a live music industry in lockdown turmoil. The result was the band’s first EP which earned the band rapid attention and a cohort of loyal fans

               Formed in the early 70s, AC/DC have released 18 studio albums since they debuted with High Voltage in 1975. Building an audience throughout their early years thanks to the strength of their live reputation, the band hit the mainstream with 1979’s Highway to Hell, an international success of a record and their first to enter the Billboard 200. This would be the album that cemented them as one of rock and roll’s biggest acts – a position that they still hold to this day. Their eighteenth studio album, Power Up, arrived in 2020. It debuted at No.1 in Australia, the US and the UK and received a Grammy nod for Best Rock Album.

A brand-new show from the hugely talented band and Alex Horne, the creator and co-host of the BAFTA and National Comedy Award winning Taskmaster.

               AC/DC, arguably the greatest rock band of all time, are brought to life by Live/Wire with the true passion you would expect from professional musicians who share your love of this legendary live act. They deliver a critically acclaimed High Voltage two hour rock ’n’ roll set with not only cannons and a full bank of Marshall amps but a journey that takes fans from one of the best-selling albums of all time ‘Back in Black’ through to the 2020 release ‘PWR UP’, with a healthy dose of the classics from the Bon Scott era.<br><br>The Live/Wire show combines the vocal power of Podge Blacksmith as Brian Johnson, the virtuoso talent of Simon Davies as Angus Young and rhythmic accuracy of Dan Mosley as Malcolm Young. The line-up is completed by Eddie Clark as bassist Cliff Williams and Paul Alwin combining the groove of Phil Rudd and thunderous energy of Chris Slade on drums.<br><br>With over 20 years of touring under their belt, Live/Wire put the audience right in the middle of a live experience comparable to that only AC/DC themselves produce. We invite AC/DC fans to join us, sing with us and relive some of those classic AC/DC concerts of the past on our very own Highway to Hell.

               The Hives… on a creative hiatus… surely not? Yet, while it has been over ten years since the Swedish band’s last album, 2012’s Lex Hives, anyone fearing they have fallen into the ageing rock cliche of an act touring on past glories can rest easy. Yes, The Death Of Randy Fitzsimmons is The Hives first full album in over a decade, but as its macabre title hints, the reason for the band’s absence from the studio has been uniquely and suitably The Hives. There was a problem… the increasingly long absence of The Hives’ founder, mentor and songwriter, the limelight-shunning Randy Fitzsimmons. Now, returning for their final act since his mysterious disappearance, the band have delivered a record that is not just worthy of their legacy, but one that adds fresh lustre to The Hives. The Death Of Randy Fitzsimmons is a true renaissance.

               ‘I don’t think any musician ever thinks about making a statement’, said Hugh Masekela, the late, great ’father of South African jazz’ – ‘I think everybody goes into music loving it.’ Tonight’s Prom showcases the most dynamic sounds in contemporary South African jazz, including those of Cry Freedom’s Jonas Gwangwa, genre-crossing composer Abdullah Ibrahim, Dudu Pukwana and Johnny Dyani of The Blue Notes, and saxophonist Winston Mankunku. Singer Siyabonga Mthembu makes a special appearance, together with Mercury Prize-nominated ESKA, double MOBO Award-winning saxophonist Soweto Kinch and tuba sensation Theon Cross. Plus, if there’s one group that’s absolutely guaranteed to set the Proms on fire, it’s Metropole Orkest – the globetrotting, genre-defying ensemble behind recent Proms tributes to Nina Simone, Charles Mingus and Quincy Jones.

               Having toured relentlessly since 1970, playing almost 4,600 shows in 80 countries in the ensuing half a century, Elton made the decision in 2017 that it was time to come off the road so he could fully embrace the next important chapter of his life and dedicate more time to his family. The Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour subsequently broke records, pushed boundaries and shattered expectations in a five year period of celebratory activity that solidified Elton’s status in the very highest echelons of popular culture across the generations.
